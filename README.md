# DotDash-eCommerce-Trends
In-depth sales and performance analysis for DotDash's ecommerce business, shedding insights into historical sales trends, site initiatives, marketing performance, and operational efficiency.

The pivot tables and charts outlining this analysis can be found in the attached workbooks.

## Executive Summary
Sales and order count are up 28% in 2022, compared to 2019. DotDash experienced a great boom in 2020 as customer behavior shifted to ordering online. However beginning in 2022, a sharp decline in sales, average order value (aov) and order count has ensued. Fortunately there are still several ways to continue to capture value and grow.

### Product Performance
These are 4 products that make up more than 96% of total sales, with Airpods being ordered 45% of the time. If sales growth through an expanded product portfolio is an option, it is recommended to find similar, in-class products to maximize sales performance.

### Marketing Efforts
To reduce friction for customers, prioritize driving traffic to the website (97% of total sales) instead of the mobile app. Continue driving traffic to the website via the direct and email marketing channels as these channels account for 95% of total sales, YOY. Within our regional markets there is further opportunity for growth. Observe the countries that drive the majority of regional value. Even though the APAC region provides 12% of total sales, it may be worth exploring focusing marketing efforts due to these customers having the highest AOV.

### Loyalty Program
After launching in 2019, the loyalty program now accounts for more than half of total revenue and has a less volatile, more resilient AOV than non-loyalty customers. The loyalty program may provide an avenue to maintain some of the value capture from 2020's boom.
