# DotDash's Background
Founded at the end of 2018, DotDash provides customers around the world with high-tech electronics and accessories. With a wealth of order, customer, and geographic data, DotDash is now prioritizing analysis to uncover valuable insights. These insights will be pivotal in identifying opportunities for improvement and providing actionable next steps to support growth in a competitive landscape. 


## Overview
From 2019 - 2022 over 108K orders were placed, generating $28.1M in sales. Across these 4 years, sales and order count are up 28%. Not to be overlooked is DotDash's meteoric sales boom in 2020 (163%). A signficant portion of this rise can be attributed to the paradigm shift in customer behavior, to order online, observed during the start of the pandemic. However beginning in 2022, the trend in sales, average order value (aov) and order count has taken a sharp dive. Hence, the battle lies in finding ways to maintain the brand reach captured during 2020 and 2021, which should outline our path to longer-term growth.

## Summary of Insights

### Seasonality 
DotDash sees a holiday sales surge, each year in November (18%) and December (23%). Additionally, we see a bounceback in sales of roughly 18% in March after sales decline in February. The worst months are February and October, which see sales dip by about -27% on average during these months. While DotDash's sales trend follow common seasonality for companies selling electronics, these figures offer insights into consumer behavior. The ‘best’ deals in consumers' eyes start to run through the holiday season so customers in October may be waiting for ‘deal season’ to start in November or are finding deals elsewhere.

### Product Performance
Apple Airpods are DotDash's most popular product by order count, comprising 45% of all orders. The 27in 4K Gaming Monitor is DotDash's top revenue generating product, bringing in almost $10M (35% of sales). Paired with the Gaming Monitor and Airpods, the Macbook Air and ThinkPad Laptops generate 96% of revenue.

### Global Reach
DotDash had customers place orders from 191 countries. However, 17 countries generate 85% of total sales. Observe the countries that drive the majority of regional value. Even though the APAC region provides 12% of total sales, it may be worth exploring focusing marketing efforts due to these customers having the highest AOV.

### Loyalty Program
The loyalty program may provide an avenue to maintain some of the value captured in 2020's boom. Starting in ‘21, sales and order count from loyalty customers exceeded that of non-loyalty customers. This trend continued through ‘22 with the bonus of AOV of loyalty customers also exceeding that of non-loyalty customers.

## Recommendations

### Product Performance
1) Based on the consumer preference for wireless in-ear headphones, gaming monitors and laptops, DotDash should expand its product catalog to offer similar, in-class products to improve sales performance and brand reach.

### Global Presence
1) Knowing where the vast majority of orders and sales come from, DotDash should concentrate marketing efforts on continuing to penetrate these top markets, in the short-term. DotDash should work to identify 'similar' countries, to its top performers, to create growth opportunities over the longer-term.

2) It is also in DotDash's best interest to prioritize experimenting in the APAC region. Even though this region accounts for 12% of sales, it has the highest AOV. Pairing that with consumer tendencies of the region to purchase higher-priced "status symbols", efforts to penetrat this market should provide a significant boost in sales.

### Loyalty Program
There is a cause for concern that should be noted and monitored for a set amount of time before decisions to continue or cut the program are made.
- From Sep through Dec ‘22, non-loyalty customer sales, aov and order count has surpassed the metrics of loyalty customers. This is the first time since Dec ‘20 order count of non-loyalty customers has exceeded that of loyalty customers.
-- Until these most recent micro trends, there has been evidence to support the loyalty program as a key way to maintaining captured value, given DotDash's overall sales have been declining since ‘20 (add a part about AOV).
